This training material uses [[https://github.com/adamzap/landslide][landslide]] to build the slides used with
the [[https://github.com/akrabat/avalanche][avalanche]] theme.

To generate the slide deck simply run

#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src

By default both dark and light versions of the presentation are
generated.

** Known Issues
- Examples do not always fit on the screen
- PDF is quite ugly with many things cut off

** Contribution Guidance
- Example policy should go into examples directory
- Examples should be self-contained or designed for use with
  services_autorun
- When modifying the way things look use themes/*.css dont alter
  upstream themes
